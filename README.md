# Finance Buddy
Finance buddy is a financial budgeting application. This application is intended to be free, open source, and self-hostable. 
Financal Buddy is split into separate front-end and back-end repositories. This repository contains an ASP.NET Core API back-end for the Financial Buddy application.
The front-end code is encapsulated and stored in another repository. 

The Financial Buddy web-app front-end code can be found here: https://github.com/loganmj/finance-buddy-web-frontend

## TODO: Docker
This repository will utilize Github actions to package the backend code into a docker container and upload it to Dockerhub.
